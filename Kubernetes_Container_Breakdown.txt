A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its 
dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing 
environment to another.

Containers are more like laptops than desktops. Desktops need to have a mouse,
keyboard, and other external dependencies in order to run smoothly. Laptops one
the other hand come pre-packaged with everything you need in order to run the 
machine. You don't need a mouse, camera, keyboard, and you can take it anywhere
with you. 

Containers put everything your software needs into one portable package. You 
have application code, config files, OS libraries, dependencies and more
packaged into one container and shipped out, allowing for consistency across 
different environments. 

Containers use far less resources than virtual machines.

A container runtime is the software used to run containers on a machine.

Kubernetes, also known is K8s, is an open-source system for automating 
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes helps you deploy containers across a pool of compute resources, such 
as servers. K8s allows you to easily manage multiple replicas of your application
within the pool of servers. You can send the containers to K8s and have K8s 
send the replicas to mulitple servers at a time. K8s also makes it easy for you
to scale your application up or down, allowing you to add more applications
or decrease the number to your choosing. 

K8s provides a framework for managing and controlling your containers' network 
communications. It offers a variety of features that give you the ability to 
build more secure applications. K8s can also help you manage application 
configuration and pass the config data to your containers.
