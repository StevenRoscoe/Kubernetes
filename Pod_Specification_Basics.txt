When it comes to configuring a pod in Kubernetes you only need the following
basic requirements to create and get the pod running:

kind- specifies the obgject type as Pod.
metadata.name- the name of the Pod object.
spec.containers- provides a list of one or more containers included in the Pod.
spec.containers[].image- specifies the name of a container image containing the 
software you want to run.

Here is an example of a basic nginx-configured Pod in YAML format:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:                          -You can also add in the port you want to expose the Pod to.
    - containerPort: 80
